### Why Des Moines, Iowa ?

Though it has a low population for bike sharing compared to some other cities [see page 23 of "Bike-Share Opportunities in NYC"](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/plans/transportation/bike_share_complete.pdf) it may have potential in the future.

## Things to be considered 

I don't think Des Moines, Iowa would be the greatest place at the moment due to its relatively small population. However its growing community is encouraging, and it is worth studying the population trends of Des Moines and how long people stay in Des Moines. If there is a significant part of the population who is within a short distance (<5 miles) from work, Des Moines may be more likely to have significant numbers of subscribers.
