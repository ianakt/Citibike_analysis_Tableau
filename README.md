# Des Moines, Iowa citibike

## Purpose:

To show the current trends in bike sharing in the NYC area, and how it could translate to Des Moines Iowa. In this analysis we include, the ride and subscriber rates by gender, and the riding trends through out a typical day. 

### Why Des Moines, Iowa ?

Des Moines, Iowa has a growing population, according to [US Census Data](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/desmoinescityiowa) Des Moines grew by 5% in the last 10 years. Though it has a low population for bike sharing compared to some other cities [see page 23 of "Bike-Share Opportunities in NYC"](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/plans/transportation/bike_share_complete.pdf) it may have potential in the future.

## Analysis

Overall we can see that there are more male than female users, the popular times are between 7 and 9 am on the weekdays, and that subscribers use citibikes more often.

## Things to be considered 

I don't think Des Moines, Iowa would be the greatest place at the moment due to its relatively small population. However its growing community is encouraging, and it is worth studying the population trends of Des Moines and how long people stay in Des Moines. If there is a significant part of the population who is within a short distance (<5 miles) from work, Des Moines may be more likely to have significant numbers of subscribers.
